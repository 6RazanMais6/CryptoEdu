![CryptoEdu Logo](https://your-repository-url/logo.png) ????

## Overview

CryptoEdu is an interactive web application designed to teach and demonstrate classical encryption techniques. The platform provides hands-on experience with various ciphers, step-by-step explanations of encryption and decryption processes, and tools for analyzing and breaking ciphers.

## Features

- **Interactive Cipher Implementations:**
  - Affine Cipher (encryption, decryption, and cryptanalysis)
  - Caesar Cipher (with brute force attack capability)
  - Vigenère Cipher
  - Playfair Cipher
  - Hill Cipher (2×2 and 3×3 matrices)
  - Extended Euclidean Algorithm calculator

- **Educational Components:**
  - Step-by-step explanations for each encryption/decryption operation
  - Visual representations of cipher mechanics
  - Historical context and security analysis
  - Matrix operations visualization for Hill cipher

- **User Features:**
  - User authentication system
  - Encryption history tracking
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - Next.js 14 (App Router)
  - React 18
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS
  - shadcn/ui component library

- **State Management:**
  - React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
  - Context API for user authentication

- **Styling:**
  - Tailwind CSS for responsive design
  - CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
